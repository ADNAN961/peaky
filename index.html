            <h1>About Us</h1> 
            <p>"Peaky Blinders is a British period crime drama television series 
                created by Steven Knight. Set in Birmingham, 
                it follows the exploits of the Peaky Blinders crime gang in
                the direct aftermath of the First World War. The fictional gang 
                is loosely based on a real urban youth gang of the 
                same name who were active in the city from the 1880s to the 1910"</p>

            <h1>Thomas Shelby</h1> 
            <p>"Thomas Michael Shelby was born in Birmingham, England, 
                around 1890 to an Irish Traveller and Romani family and grew 
                up in the Small Heath neighbourhood of Birmingham. He dated 
                Greta Jurossi, a woman of Italian descent during his 20s, but
                 she died of tuberculosis. His experiences as a sergeant major
                  during the First World War have resulted in him suffering
                 from PTSD and it is implied he returned from it as a changed 
                 man."</p>

            <h1>Cillian Murphy</h1>
            <p>"Cillian Murphy had expressed an interest in doing more 
                television roles, "Those iconic American shows had 
                been on and we watched them and everyone was kind 
                of conscious of that. I think the BBC were conscious 
                of that and so I was keen to read some good scripts 
                and they [Peaky Blinders] were the first TV scripts 
                I got sent". Murphy admitted that he was not aware of 
                who the Peaky Blinders were when he was initially presented 
                with the script."</p>
